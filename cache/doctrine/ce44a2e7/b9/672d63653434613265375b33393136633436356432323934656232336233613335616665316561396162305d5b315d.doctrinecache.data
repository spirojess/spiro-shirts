<p>Particles are incredibly simple building blocks that Gantry 5 themes thrive on. They are easy to set up, require no coding experience to configure, and are built on an intuitive and human-readable Twig and YAML file structure that makes developing them a breeze. You can use particles to set up your logo, display content in a way that complements the theme design, and more.</p>";s:12:"content_meta";N;}
