# Privacy Policy

We do not sell or give away personal information of any visitor who comes to our website. However, we may collect and retain certain information about you (see next 2 paragraphs).

Only when you use our website contact form do we collect the name, email address, and message that you give to us.  We will only use this information that you entered on the contact form for the specific purpose of communicating with you alone.

As is true of most websites, we automatically gather information about your computer such as your IP address, browser type, referring & exit pages, and operating system. We use this information under our roof to improve the content and layout of our website. The info is just lumped together to form the number of a statistic that does not include personal information. It helps us guage the amount of traffic that is passing by the page, and get a sense of interest for the products and services that we offer. We use another company (Google Analytics) to place cookies on your computer to collect Non-personally identifiable information to compile aggregated statistics for us about visitors to our site.

Our site includes links that direct you away from our site to other websites whose privacy practices may differ from those of Spiro Graphics. If you submit personal information to any of those sites, your information is governed by their privacy statements. We have no control over information that you submit to other sites.  We think you should carefully read the privacy statement of any website you visit, and thatâ€™s why you are here reading this in the first place - well done you.

Remember that certain providers may be located in or have facilities that are located in a different jurisdiction than you or than us. So if you elect to proceed with a transaction that involves the services of a third-party service provider, your information may become subject to the laws of the jurisdiction(s) in which that service provider or its facilities are located. As an example, if you are located in Canada and your transaction is processed by a payment gateway located in the United States, then your personal information used in completing that transaction may be subject to disclosure under United States legislation, including the Patriot Act. Once you leave our website or are redirected to a third-party website or application, you are no longer governed by this privacy policy.

The security of your personal information is very important to us. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100 percent secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

By using this site, you represent that you are at least the age of majority in your state or province of residence, or that you are the age of majority in your state or province of residence and you have given us your consent to allow any of your minor dependents to use this site.

We reserve the right to modify this privacy policy at any time, so please review it frequently. Changes and clarifications will take effect immediately upon their posting on the website. 

If you have any questions or concerns about our website, please contact us online.
